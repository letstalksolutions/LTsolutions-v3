# ADR 0004: Gemini research timing

## Status
Decided

## Context
Should Gemini research run before or after Sky implements homepage v1?

## Decision
Gemini research is **not required now**. Defer to post-v1.

## Rationale

**Why not now:**
- Positioning is locked (docs/positioning/primary-offer.md)
- Homepage copy is locked (docs/content/homepage-copy.md)
- "Ship v1 quickly" objective from status.md takes priority
- Research would delay implementation without changing v1 scope

**When Gemini should run (post-v1):**
- Competitor messaging analysis for v1.1 copy refinements
- SEO keyword validation for meta tags and headings
- Industry benchmarks for trust indicators
- Content gap analysis for services and insights pages

## Questions for future Gemini research

1. What messaging do top Atlassian partners use for JSM/Assets/Opsgenie services?
2. What search terms do IT operations leaders use when looking for Atlassian help?
3. What proof points (case studies, certifications, stats) do competitors emphasise?
4. What content gaps exist on current LT.Solutions site vs competitors?

## Next action
Proceed with Sky implementation. Queue Gemini research for post-v1 iteration.
