## Problem and outcome bullets

| Pain | Outcome |
|------|---------|
| Tickets disappear into queues with no visibility | Traceable escalations from support to engineering |
| Manual handoffs slow everything down | Workflow automation that reduces effort and improves consistency |
| Knowledge lives in people's heads, not systems | Documentation and practices teams can maintain without the consultant |
| CMDB is out of date or unused | Assets (CMDB) implemented with practical, asset-centric operations |
| Incidents handled reactively with unclear ownership | Opsgenie aligned to incident management, on-call, and comms |
