# Gemini research: Brand, logo, and design best practices

Read agents/init-gemini-aladdin.md before acting.

## Context
LT.Solutions is rebuilding their website. Need global research on design best practices for B2B consultancy / Atlassian partner industry, plus brand assessment.

IMPORTANT: The current live lt.solutions site should NOT be used as a design reference - it has FE quality issues.

## Research questions

### 1. Global design best practices
Research 5-10 top B2B consultancy and Atlassian partner websites globally:
- What design patterns do high-converting sites use?
- Hero section best practices
- Service/pricing card layouts
- Trust signal placement
- CTA design and placement
- Mobile-first patterns

### 2. Logo assessment
- Does current LT.Solutions logo convey: professional, Atlassian-aligned, trustworthy?
- Compare to top Atlassian partners (Valiantys, Eficode, Adaptavist, Cprime, Isos Technology)
- Is refresh needed or is current logo sufficient?

### 3. Color palette review
Current palette:
- Navy: #0B1728
- Red: #C41E3A
- Atlassian Blue: #0052CC
- Trust Green: #00875A

Questions:
- Does this palette align with Atlassian brand guidelines?
- Is red appropriate for a B2B consultancy?
- Any color psychology concerns?

### 3. Typography assessment
Current fonts:
- Headings: Space Grotesk
- Body: Inter

Questions:
- Are these appropriate for enterprise B2B?
- Any better alternatives worth considering?

### 4. Competitor brand comparison
Review 3-5 Atlassian partner websites:
- What brand patterns do they use?
- How do they balance Atlassian alignment with own identity?
- Any standout examples?
