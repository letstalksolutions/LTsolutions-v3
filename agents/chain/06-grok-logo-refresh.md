# Grok: Logo Refresh Concepts

Read agents/init-grok-aurora.md before acting.

## IMPORTANT: Use Image Generation
**DO NOT write SVG code.** Use your image generation capability (Aurora) to create actual designed PNG images. Generate real visual logo designs, not programmatic shapes.

## Context
Both design review and brand research identified the logo as needing a refresh. Current logo has colour misalignment (uses #BD0A0A instead of brand red #C41E3A) and may not meet modern digital-first standards.

## Reference
- Brand research: `docs/research/brand-research.md`
- Design review: `docs/reviews/design-review-homepage.md`
- Current logo location: `site/images/` (check for existing assets)

## Company Info
- **Name:** LT.Solutions (or LT Solutions, Let's Talk Solutions)
- **Tagline options:** "Atlassian Excellence" / "Service Operations Experts"
- **Industry:** B2B Atlassian consultancy (JSM, Assets, Opsgenie)
- **Feel:** Enterprise credible + human approachable

## Brand Palette
- Navy: #0B1728 (primary background)
- Red: #C41E3A (accent - use sparingly)
- White: #FFFFFF (logo should work on dark navy)

## Requirements

### Generate 3-4 logo concepts:

**Concept 1: Clean Wordmark**
- Typography-focused "LT.Solutions" or "LT Solutions"
- Modern sans-serif (inspired by Space Grotesk)
- Works on dark navy background
- Minimal, confident

**Concept 2: Monogram + Wordmark**
- "LT" monogram/icon paired with company name
- Icon should work standalone (favicon, avatar)
- Geometric, simple

**Concept 3: Abstract Mark + Wordmark**
- Abstract symbol representing connection/solutions/flow
- Not literal (no puzzle pieces, gears, etc.)
- Subtle nod to Atlassian ecosystem without copying

**Concept 4: (Optional) Bold Direction**
- Your creative interpretation
- Push boundaries while staying professional

### For each concept provide:
1. Full logo (icon + wordmark if applicable)
2. Horizontal layout
3. Description of rationale
4. Notes on where it would/wouldn't work

## Technical Notes
- Design for dark backgrounds primarily (navy #0B1728)
- Also consider white/light background version
- Output will need vectorization later
- Keep shapes simple enough to convert to SVG

## Output
Use image generation to create PNG files. Save to `lab/generated/` with names:
- `logo-concept-1-wordmark.png`
- `logo-concept-2-monogram.png`
- `logo-concept-3-abstract.png`
- `logo-concept-4-bold.png`

## Do Not
- Write SVG or any code - USE IMAGE GENERATION ONLY
- Use stock/clip art elements
- Copy Atlassian's logo style directly
- Create overly complex marks
