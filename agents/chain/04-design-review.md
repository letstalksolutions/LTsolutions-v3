# Design Expert: Homepage polish review

Read agents/init-claude-code-design-expert.md before acting.

## Context
Homepage v1 is implemented at site/index.html. Service cards v2 with gradient CTAs are in place. Need design polish review before launch.

## Reference
Current implementation: site/index.html

IMPORTANT: Do NOT use the live lt.solutions site as a design reference. It has FE quality issues. Instead, research global best practices for B2B consultancy and Atlassian partner websites.

## Review tasks

### 1. Visual polish assessment
Compare site/index.html against live site and identify:
- Spacing inconsistencies
- Typography hierarchy issues
- Color/contrast problems
- Animation/transition smoothness
- Card alignment and grid issues
- Button styling consistency

### 2. Component review
Evaluate each section:
- Hero (gradient text, CTAs, trust signals)
- Problem/outcome cards
- Service cards v2 (icon, badge, benefits, CTA)
- Phase cards (glass effect)
- Proof/stats section
- Footer

### 3. Brand assessment
Advise on:
- Is current logo suitable or needs refresh?
- Color palette working well?
- Typography choices appropriate?
- Overall brand feel: enterprise credible + human approachable?

### 4. Mobile review
Check at 320px, 768px, 1024px:
- Layout breaks
- Touch target sizes
- Text readability
- Navigation usability

## Output
Write findings to: docs/reviews/design-review-homepage.md
