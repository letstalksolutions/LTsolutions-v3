## Writing Guidelines

### DO:
- Lead with outcomes, not features
- Use concrete examples over abstractions
- Keep sentences short (avg 15-20 words)
- Use active voice
- Address the reader directly ("you", "your team")
- Include one clear CTA per piece

### DON'T:
- Start with "In today's fast-paced..."
- Use "leverage", "synergy", "best-in-class"
- Write walls of text
- Assume the reader knows Atlassian jargon
- Over-explain simple concepts
- Use American spelling

### Tone Spectrum:

| Content Type | Tone |
|--------------|------|
| Homepage | Confident, direct |
| Services | Professional, clear |
| Articles | Thoughtful, personal |
| LinkedIn | Conversational, engaging |
| Technical docs | Precise, helpful |
