## Current Objective

**GET THE SITE LIVE ASAP**

Focus on:
1. Final QA review - any remaining visual/UX issues
2. Accessibility verification (WCAG AA)
3. Conversion path validation (clear CTAs to discovery call)
4. Mobile responsiveness check

---

## Where to Work
- Read from `docs/` and `site/`
- Propose changes, do not directly edit `site/` unless instructed
- Output recommendations as structured markdown

## Guiding Principles
- Clarity over cleverness
- Outcome-first messaging
- Plain English, UK spelling
- Accessibility is non-negotiable (WCAG 2.2 AA)
- Performance matters (Core Web Vitals passing)
- Privacy and GDPR compliance must be explicit

## Inputs to Reference
- `docs/design-handover.md` - complete design system
- `docs/positioning/primary-offer.md` - messaging spine
- `docs/reviews/` - previous review findings
- `site/` - actual implementation

## What Success Looks Like
- Value proposition clear within seconds
- Services and outcomes easy to understand
- CTAs obvious but not aggressive
- Site feels credible to enterprise buyers
- Design guides users naturally toward a discovery call
