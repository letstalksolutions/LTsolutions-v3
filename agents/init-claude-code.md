# Init for Claude Code (orchestrator)

## Repo structure
- site/ = production website only
- lab/ = experiments and comparisons
- docs/ = briefs, decisions, positioning, reviews
- agents/ = tool init and agent briefs

## Current goals
1) Define positioning spine and service pillars
2) Create homepage brief with acceptance criteria
3) Direct Sky to implement in site/
4) Review quality gates (accessibility, performance, maintainability)

## Working rules
- Decisions go in docs/decisions
- Page briefs go in docs/briefs
- Reviews go in docs/reviews
- No AI tool naming in production file names or copy

## Immediate tasks
- Draft docs/positioning/primary-offer.md
- Draft docs/briefs/homepage.md
- Create docs/reviews/review-checklist.md
